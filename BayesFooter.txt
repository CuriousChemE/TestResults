<p>Why?  Take a look at the breakdown of 1000 people tested at random (in the left-most table below the chart).    At 2% prevalence, out of 1000 people tested at random, you expect 20 to actually have COVID-19, and 980 to not have it.  Of the 20 who have it, 14 would be expected to test positively, and 6 (30% of the total with the disease) would be expected to test negatively.  Of the 980 who DON’T have it, 951 would be expected to test negatively, and only 3% would test positive.  However, this 3% of a large number (980) consists of 29 people who would test (false) positively but not have the disease, and is much larger than 30% of the much smaller population (20) who do have COVID-19.  Therefore, if you test positively, the likelihood of actually HAVING COVID-19 is only ~32%, or 14/(14+29), despite the test only having 3% false positives.  Likewise, the likelihood of having COVID-19 given a negative test is only 0.6%, or 951/(951+6).</p><p>At 10% prevalence, a positive test result is a much more reliable indicator of having the disease.  At 10% you’d expect 100 out of 1000 people tested at random to actually have the disease.  Of these 100, 70 would test positively, and 30 would test negatively.  Out of the 900 who don’t have the disease, 873 would test negatively, and 27 would test positively.  So the likelihood of someone with a positive test result having COVID-19 with in this case is now 70/(70+27).   In other words, a positive test result in New York City is more likely to indicate having the disease than the same test result in a less affected region.</p><p>What if you instead wanted to know the likelihood of having COVID-19 if you have the commonly known symptoms (and did not have a test taken)?  Again, we can use Bayes’ theorem.  We would need to know the likelihood of having symptoms if you have COVID-19 (there have been reports of asymptomatic cases may actually outnumber symptomatic cases of COVID-19), the likelihood of having symptoms if you DON’T have COVID-19 (maybe you have the flu and not COVID-19), and, as above, the prevalence of COVID-19 in your local population.  For argument’s sake, if we revert to 2% prevalence, and assume that 50% of those with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, and that 0.5% of the population has the symptoms but not COVID-19, then out of our population of 1000 there are 20 with COVID-19, 10 with symptoms and 10 without.  Of the 980 without COVID-19, 5 (the 0.5%) will have symptoms, and the rest (975) will not have symptoms.   In this case, if you have symptoms, the likelihood of having COVID-19 is about 67% (much higher than the likelihood of a random person having COVID-19 if they receive a positive test result in the case of only 2% prevalence).</p><p>As you would expect, being symptomatic AND receiving a positive test result is generally a more reliable indicator of having COVID-19 than merely having a positive test result.  Once again, we can rely on Bayes’ theorem for insights.  This result is because we replace the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population with the prevalence of COVID-19 in the SYMPTOMATIC portion of the population (which we would expect to be higher).  The right-most two sets of bars on the chart (and right-most two tables) interpret the test results given whether you are either symptomatic or asymptomatic.</p>
