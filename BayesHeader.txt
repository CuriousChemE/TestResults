<H2>Interpreting Medical Test Results in Light of Bayes’ Theorem</H2><p>In this posting, we provide an interactive graphic to use  Bayes’ theorem to assess the likelihood of an individual having a disease (e.g. COVID-19) given a positive or negative test result (assuming that you have randomly taken the test), given having symptoms but not having received a test, given being symptomatic AND having received a test result, and finally, being asymptomatic and having received a test result.  One interesting observation is that, in regions with very low prevalence of COVID-19, being symptomatic may be a more reliable indicator than a single positive test result.  Please note: while the parameters used in this exercise are intended to be “reasonable”, <i>please do not rely on this posting for medical advice</i>!  Instead, this posting is intended to explain Bayes’ theorem, the concepts of false positive and false negative medical test results, and how Bayes’ theorem can help us understand the impacts of these concepts. By playing around with the interactive graphic, you can see how modifying parameters impacts the interpretation of test results, and hopefully come to understand the power of Bayes’ theorem.</p><p>Diagnostic tests for diseases aren’t perfect.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, you’ve likely heard terms such as sensitivity, selectivity, false positives, and false negatives.  These values of these terms are specific to each test protocol, and are determined during test development on known samples.  A “false negative” is a negative test result when you actually have a disease, and the expected percent of false negative results from testing a population with the disease is  equal to 100% minus the “test sensitivity”.  Likewise, a “false positive” is a positive test result when you actually DON’T have the disease, and the expected percent of false positives results from testing a population without the disease is  equal to 100% minus the “test specificity”. </p><p>However, what you most likely <i>really</i> care about is the likelihood that you actually have a disease if you get a positive (or negative) test result.  This is different than the likelihood of getting a positive or negative test result if you already know you have (or know you don’t have) the disease, which are known from the reported test sensitivity and specificity.  After all, when you get tested for a disease, you get tested because you don’t know whether you have it or not.</p><p>Fortunately, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem>Bayes’ Theorem</a> tells us:</p><p>Probability of B given A = (Probability of A given B) x (Probability of B)/(Probability of A)</p><p>In our case, the probability of COVID-19 (B) given a positive test result (A) is what we <i>want</i> to know.  We know the probability of a positive test given COVID-19 as the test sensitivity.   The probability of COVID-19 for an individual is the “prevalence” of COVID-19 in the general population.  But what is the probability of A (a positive test result in the general population)? A  positive test result is either a “true positive” (you have the disease) or a “false positive” (you don’t have the disease).  Therefore, the probability of a positive test result for the general population is:</p><p>(Test sensitivity) x (COVID-19 prevalence) +  (100%-test specificity) x (100% - COVID-19 prevalence) </p><p>You’ll have noticed that we need to estimate the prevalence of the disease in the general population to use Bayes’ Theorem to interpret an individual test result.  As you will see, at low prevalence rates, we might actually see more false positives than true positives, even at what seems to be a very high test specificity (low false positive rate).  To understand why, you can adjust the prevalence in the interactive graphic below to see how varying the prevalence changes our interpretation of a test result.  Let’s use values of 70% test sensitivity (or 30% false negatives), and 97% test specificity (or 3% false positives), as COVID-19 RT-PCR tests are understood to have higher specificity than selectivity. (Note that COVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity are not fully understood, and can depend on many factors.)</p><p>At 2% prevalence of the disease in the population (given 70% sensitivity and 97% selectivity), Bayes’ theorem tells us that someone receiving a positive test result has only about 32% likelihood of actually having the disease.  At 10% prevalence, that likelihood goes up to about 72%.</p>
