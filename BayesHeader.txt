<H2>Using new information to update your assessment of the probability of something being true.</H2>
<H3>Example: Interpreting medical test results using Bayes’ Theorem</H3>
<p>Should you change your assessment of whether something is true based on new information?</p>
<p>Having changed your assessment once due to new information, should you change it again with another piece of new information?</p>
<p>Should the way you interpret new information depend on what you think you already know?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a rather straightforward mathematical equation which quantifies the answers to these questions.  This equation is known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem>Bayes’ Theorem</a>.  Well, OK, it wasn’t straightforward at all for me, until I actually plugged numbers into the equation and did some counting up of the results for different scenarios.  If you are unfamiliar with Bayes’ Theorem, or, if you are like me and have struggled with “getting” the concept, then hopefully the interactive graphical app included in this posting will help make Bayes’ Theorem more intuitive for you.</p>
<p>The example we use is the interpretation of medical test results for COVID-19.</p>
<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The intent of the app in this posting is expressly NOT to help you figure out if you have COVID-19, nor to provide any medical guidance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Instead, my objectives are for you to (a) intuitively understand how Bayes’ Theorem “works” in general, by using a timely example, (b) be able to apply this understanding to statements you may see about the impact of “false negative” and “false positive” test results, and (c) recognize how some apparently counterintuitive observations can make sense in light of Bayes’ Theorem.</p>
<p>In this posting, we provide an interactive graphic to use Bayes’ Theorem to assess the likelihood of an individual having a disease (e.g. COVID-19) given a positive or negative test result (assuming that the individual has been tested at random), given having symptoms but not having received a test, given being symptomatic AND having received a test result, and finally, being asymptomatic and having received a test result.  One interesting observation is that, in regions with very low prevalence of COVID-19, being symptomatic may be a more reliable indicator than a single positive test result under certain conditions.  Please note: while the parameter values used in this exercise are intended to be “reasonable”, <i>once again, please do not rely on this posting for medical advice</i>!</p>
<p>Diagnostic tests for diseases aren’t perfect.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, you’ve likely heard terms such as sensitivity, selectivity, false positives, and false negatives.  These values of these terms are specific to each test protocol, and are determined during test development on known samples.  A “false negative” is a negative test result on someone who actually has the disease, and the expected percent of false negative results from testing a population with the disease is  equal to 100% minus the “test sensitivity”.  Likewise, a “false positive” is a positive test result on someone who actually DOESN’T have the disease, and the expected percent of false positives results from testing a population without the disease is  equal to 100% minus the “test specificity”. </p>
<p>However, what someone most likely <i>really</i> cares about is the likelihood that they actually have a disease if they get a positive (or negative) test result.  This is different than the likelihood of getting a positive or negative test result if someone already knows they have (or know they don’t have) the disease, which are known from the reported test sensitivity and specificity.  After all, when someone get tested for a disease, they generally get tested because they don’t know whether they have it or not.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem>Bayes’ Theorem</a> tells us:</p><p>Probability of B given A = (Probability of A given B) x (Probability of B)/(Probability of A)</p><p>In our case, the probability of COVID-19 (B) given a positive test result (A) is what we <i>want</i> to know.  We know the probability of a positive test given COVID-19 as the test sensitivity.   The probability of COVID-19 for an individual is the “prevalence” of COVID-19 in the general population.  But what is the probability of A (a positive test result in the general population)? A  positive test result is either a “true positive” (they have the disease) or a “false positive” (they don’t have the disease).  Therefore, the probability of a positive test result for the general population is:</p><p>(Test sensitivity) x (COVID-19 prevalence) +  (100%-test specificity) x (100% - COVID-19 prevalence) </p>
<p>You’ll have noticed that we need to estimate the prevalence of the disease in the general population to use Bayes’ Theorem to interpret an individual test result.  As you will see, at low prevalence rates, we might actually see more false positives than true positives, even at what seems to be a very high test specificity (low false positive rate).  To understand why, you can adjust the prevalence in the interactive graphic below to see how varying the prevalence changes our interpretation of a test result.  Let’s use values of 70% test sensitivity (or 30% false negatives), and 97% test specificity (or 3% false positives), as COVID-19 RT-PCR tests are understood to have higher specificity than selectivity. (Note that COVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity are not fully understood, and can depend on many factors.)</p><p>At 2% prevalence of the disease in the population (given 70% sensitivity and 97% selectivity), Bayes’ theorem tells us that someone receiving a positive test result has only about 32% likelihood of actually having the disease.  At 10% prevalence, that likelihood goes up to about 72%.</p>
